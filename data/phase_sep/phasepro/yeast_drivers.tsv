It suppresses the flux of inert macromolecules >30 kDa but allows rapid passage of even very large cargoes, provided these are bound to appropriate nuclear transport receptors (facilitated translocation). FG-rich nucleoporin repeats constitute the permeability barrier, they are essential for viability and engage in two known kinds of interactions: binding of NTRs and hydrogel formation that arises through inter-repeat contact. The F→S mutated Nsp1 repeats failed to form a hydrogel (PMID:17082456). A saturated hydrogel formed by a single nucleoporin FG-repeat domain is sufficient to reproduce the permeability properties of NPCs. Importin beta and related nuclear transport receptors entered such hydrogel >1000x faster than a similarly sized inert macromolecule (PMID:17693259). The NQTS-rich sequences of nucleoporins connect FG motifs in a repeat domain. In contrast to previous belief, they are, however, not just functionless spacers. Instead, they engage in amyloid-like protein-protein contacts that presumably tighten the FG hydrogel-based permeability barrier of NPCs. The cohesiveness of the NQTS-rich FG repeats appears to be so akin to that of the NQ-rich prion domain of Sup35p that the two modules interact with each other. However, while NQ-rich amyloids are very dense, tightly packed structures, where side chain stacking generates an additional anhydrous peptide interface between the β-sheets, FG hydrogel formation apparently stops before a complete collapse of the structure. Consequently, FG hydrogels include water and allow passive entry of small molecules and facilitated entry of NTRs. Too strong inter-FG repeat interactions might be counteracted by the presence of residues that form weaker β-sheets than Gln, such as Ser or Gly. Likewise, while the N-terminal segment of Nsp1p (residues 2-277) alone forms more strong hydrogels, presence of the charged C-terminal FxFG repeats of Nsp1p (residues 274-601) apparently modulate the gel strength such that NTRs can move ≈3-fold faster through the gel. Therefore, in contrast to pathological amyloids, inter-FG repeat contacts do not result in irreversible aggregates (PMID:20304795).	The FG repeats of NUPs can form an elastic hydrogel (morphology) in aqueous solution in vitro as demonstrated by gelling of 26 mg/ml wild-type fsFG-repeat domain from Nsp1 (400 μM). The F→S mutated repeat domain showed no signs of gelling and remained liquid in aqueous solution even at high concentrations (morphology). Thus, inter-repeat contacts between phenylalanines caused the gelling of the wild-type Nsp1 fsFG-repeat domain. FRAP measurement indicated that the fluorescently labeled wild-type Nsp1 fsFG-repeat domain was nearly immobile within the wild-type fsFG-repeat hydrogel. A fluorescently labeled F→S mutated repeat domain showed no interaction and diffused freely within the wild-type gel. The F→Y mutated Nsp1-repeat domains formed a homotypic hydrogel, but failed to bind NTRs (physical interaction), probably because the additional OH group at the phenyl ring cannot be accommodated into the FXFG binding pockets of the NTRs. Remarkably, nsp1 with F→Y mutated repeats fully complemented the removal of NSP1 in a wild-type background in vivo, while Nsp1 F→S could not (other change in phenotype/functional readout). These results indicate that not only the NTR binding but inter-repeat contacts and, hence, hydrogel formation is also required for NPC function and viability (PMID:17082456).; The permeability properties of NUP FG repeat hydrogels have been studied using the N-terminal region the Nsp1 protein. Permeability properties of saturated FG-hydrogels resembled those of NPCs, but unsaturated FG-hydrogels did not (morphology, other change in phenotype/functional readout). The saturated FG-hydrogel (change in protein concentration) became an efficient barrier that firmly excluded the acRedStar protein (inert probe macromolecule). The specific NTR probe, importin β rapidly dissolved within the gel, reaching a partition coefficient of >100. The FG-hydrogel thus behaved as a selective phase constituting an excellent solvent for importin β (PMID:17693259).; The N-terminal segment of Nsp1p (residues 2-277) alone forms more strong hydrogels (morphology), presence of the charged C-terminal FxFG repeats of Nsp1p (residues 274-601) apparently modulate the gel strength such that NTRs can move ≈3-fold faster through the gel in vitro. Therefore, in contrast to pathological amyloids, inter-FG repeat contacts do not result in irreversible aggregates (PMID:20304795). The regular and highly charged part of Nsp1 FG domain (residues 274–601) failed to form particles (particle size and count by microscopy) at 10 µM domain concentration on its own (PMID:25562883).

It suppresses the flux of inert macromolecules >30 kDa but allows rapid passage of even very large cargoes, provided these are bound to appropriate nuclear transport receptors (facilitated translocation). FG-rich nucleoporin repeats constitute the permeability barrier. S. cerevisiae Nup100 is a well-studied Nup98 homolog that can restore a functional permeability barrier in FG Nup-depleted Xenopus NPCs (PMID:25562883). 	A 1000 µM Nup100 FG domain stock solution supplemented by 2 M guanidinium hydrochloride (used in order to initially keep the domain molecules in a non-interacting state) was rapidly diluted in 100 volumes of a neutral Tris/NaCl buffer, which reduced the protein concentration to 10 µM (change in protein concentration) and the guanidinium ion concentration to negligible levels. Remarkably, the Nup100 FG domain solution turned instantaneously turbid (change in optical properties), pointing to a very rapid in vitro phase-separation and formation of small particles or liquid droplets, which can be easily recovered by centrifugation. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) on the 10 µM Nup100 FG domain sample showed a very prominent particle population with diameters ranging mostly between 2 and 8 µm (particle size and count). At a lower concentration (0.625 µM, change in protein concentration), a broader main peak with 0.4–4 µm particles was observed (accounting for ≈60% by mass), another peak with 25 nm assembly intermediates (10%) and residual monomers (30%) (particle size and count). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) of Nup100 FG particles, formed in the presence of 5% (vol/vol) Atto390-labeled FG domain tracers, indicated that the particle size (particle size and count) increased with higher initial concentration (change in protein concentration). Regarding their morphology, particles were of nearly spherical shape, whereby the evident deviations from perfect spheres indicated that the phase-separated objects represent solids rather than liquids. After FRAP bleaching the Atto390 fluorophore of labelled FG domains, bleached patterns within the Nup100 FG particles remained stable for some minutes at least. This indicates a solid state of the particles and stable interactions between FG domains. The simultaneously bleached NTR-signal was, however, far more dynamic. Following recombinant expression (after modest induction) FG domains from Nup100 and Nup116 had formed rather large structures (PMID:25562883). Overexpressing YFP-Nup100 FG repeat fusion in S. cerevisiae in vivo also resulted in characteristic intra-cellular foci (PMID:17418788).

In energy-depleted budding yeast and bacteria, stress causes a transition of the cytoplasm from a fluid to a protective, solid-like state. In budding yeast, the RNA-binding and stress granule protein Pub1 has an intrinsic property to form condensates upon starvation (that induces the loss of ATP and the subsequent acidification of the cytosole) or heat stress. Condensate formation is associated with cell-cycle arrest. pH- and heat-induced Pub1 condensates have different material properties. Starvation-induced Pub1 condensates form by liquid-liquid demixing and subsequently convert into reversible gel-like particles, while heat-induced condensates are more solid-like and require chaperones for disaggregation. Pub1 phase separation is primarily driven by the folded RRM domains, while the LC domain acts as a modifier that modulates the LLPS of the RRMs and ensures its responsiveness/ reversibility. Thus Pub1 is a phase-separating biosensor that can sense specific changes of the environment. Its solubility is tuned to the conditions relevant in the cytoplasm of growing yeast cells and acts as a potent stress sensor (PMID:29898402). 	In unstressed transgenic yeast cells overexpressing GFP-fused Pub1 it showed a diffue distribution in the cytoplasm (microscopy). On a pH drop in the cytoplasm, for instance as a result of starvation, Pub1 forms liquid condensates in vivo (particle size and count by microscopy). Purified GFP-fused Pub1 shows diffuse distribution among physiological conditions in vitro, however when changing the pH to 6.2 Pub1 coalesced into small foci (particle size and count by microscopy). In vitro Pub1 assemblies were sensitive to changes in salt concentration (particle size and count by microscopy). Addition of RNA reduced the number and size of Pub1 condensates in vitro (particle size and count by microscopy). The Pub1 truncation mutant comprised of only the 3 RRM domains showed more intensive condensate formation among stress in vivo (particle size and count by microscopy) than the wild type Pub1. Purified only-RRM truncated variants also showed pH- and temperature-dependent phase separation in vitro, but with a reduced reversibily than the wild type Pub1. Heat-induced Pub1 condensates are larger, more irregular, solid-like (morphology) and they require chaperones for dissolution (PMID:29898402).

In vitro, stress-granule-associated proteins can demix to form liquids, hydrogels, and other assemblies lacking fixed stochiometry. Poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1 in yeast), a defining marker of stress granules, phase separates and forms hydrogels in vitro upon explosure to physiological stress conditions (physiological thermal and pH changes). Unlike other RNA-binding proteins’, Pab1’s P-rich LCR is not required for demixing only modulates it. LLPS is mediated by its RRMs, and RNA inhibits phase separation. Pab1 acts as a physiological stress sensor, exploiting phase separation to precisely mark stress onset, a broadly generizable mechanism. Phase separation is mediated by electrostatic interactions between four RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and promoted by hydrophobic residues in Pab1’s LCR (low- complexity region) that modulates temperature sensitivity. RRM1-3 in itself is also able to phase separate (PMID:28283059). Pab1’s phase separation is tuned to occur at the organism’s heat shock temperature by modulatory hydrophobic residues in its proline-rich domain. Phase separation is mediated by its RNA binding domains, and Pab1 releases RNA during phase separation. The ability of Pab1 to autonomously sense a mere 3% change in absolute temperature, from robust growth (30°C/303K) to stress (40°C/313K), makes Pab1’s phase separation one of the most thermosensitive biomolecular processes yet found (PMID:30877200).; 	Pab1 shows diffuse localization under favorable growth conditions, and localizes to stress granules—large cytosolic foci—within minutes of a shift to 46°C in vivo (change in temperature, protein localization). Purified recombinant yeast Pab1 was soluble at 30°C in vitro but demixed to form large particles after a 30 min treatment on 46°C (change in temperature, protein localization). After incubating Pab1 with a small excess of 19-mer polyadenylate RNA (A19), shifting to 46°C for 30 min caused Pab1:RNA complexes to partially dissociate (change in temperature, protein co-localization, particle size and count), with the free protein demixing into large particles and the released A19 returning to the free pool. These results indicate that upon heat stress Pab1 releases RNA and demixes, forming particles stabilized by protein-protein interactions. Rapid particle growth in a narrow temperature window indicated the onset of demixing (change in temperature, particle size and count) by DLS. Adding RNA (change in RNA concentration) increasingly inhibited Pab1 demixing (particle size and count) by DLS. At higher salt concentrations (change in salt concentration) or above physiological pH values (change in pH), demixing was almost completely inhibited at 46°C (particle size and count). Pab1 was split into its N- and C-terminal halves, RRM1-3 and RRM4-P-C (RPC) mutation. RRM1-3 demixed,whereas RPC did not up to 50°C. Pab1deltaP mutant assemblies largely retained the droplet-cluster morphology of full-length Pab1 quinary assemblies. Mutational studies imply that Pab1 phase separates in vivo during heat shock, with temperature sensitivity modulated by its low-complexity region. Strikingly, only the three variants whose phase separation occurs at temperatures substantially above that of the WT (MV/A, MVFY/AGPNQ, and DP) showed reduced fitness under heat-shock conditions in vivo. Altered in vivo stress tolerance correlates with altered quinary assembly formation in vivo, phase separation in vitro, P domain hydrophobicity, and P domain compaction in the monomer, revealing connections between each phenomenon (PMID:28283059).

At normal expression levels and physiological temperatures, Pbp1 does not form foci-like granules and is instead present in the form of pelletable assemblies during respiratory growth. The low-complexity (LC) domain of Pbp1 forms labile, cross-b polymers that facilitate phase transition of the protein into liquid-like or gel-like states. In place of tyrosine or phenylalanine residues prototypically used for phase separation, Pbp1 contains 24 similarly disposed methionine residues. The Pbp1 methionine residues are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)-mediated oxidation in vitro and in living cells. Methionine oxidation melts Pbp1 liquid-like droplets, which in turn activates TORC1 signaling, in a manner reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductase enzymes. These observations explain how reversible formation of labile polymers by the Pbp1 LC domain enables the protein to function as a sensor of cellular redox state. Pbp1 may therefore sense respiratory status and mitochondrial dysfunction to properly modulate TORC1 signaling, thus it appears that mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death may emerge due to loss of Pbp1 following prolonged metabolic or nutritional stress, or as a function of age (PMID:30982603, PMID:30982600).	In vitro droplet formation and dissolution (particle size and count) was followed by light microscopy using 2 mg/ml His-tagged LC region of the protein, evidencing H2O2-mediated melting of Pbp1 droplets at intermediate concentrations. Concomitant mutation of eight methionine residues to serine, including residues M591, M595, M605, M606, M614, M616, M618, and M625 (M7–14 within the LC domain), yielded a protein variant designated ‘‘MS8a’’. This mutated variant of Pbp1 was observed to be incapable of polymerizing into labile cross-b polymers and was functionally inactive in its ability to couple mitochondrial activity state to autophagy in living yeast cells. The MS8a variant did become phase separated into liquid-like droplets, but these droplets differed from those formed from the native LC domain of Pbp1 in showing aberrantly rapid protein exchange (morphology). A second variant of Pbp1 also bearing eight methionine-to-serine mutations, including residues M635, M638, M659, M667, M681, M682, M689, and M696 (M17–24 within the LC domain), yielded a protein variant designated ‘‘MS8b,’’ which was fully capable of polymerizing into labile cross-b polymers. As deduced from fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) experiments, droplets formed from the MS8b variant are endowed with a slow exchange rate indistinguishable from droplets derived from the native LC domain. Finally, the MS8b variant effectively recapitulated the function of Pbp1 in living yeast cells. In vivo, in yeast cells, under culture conditions demanding intense mitochondrial respiration, the majority of Pbp1 partitions to the pellet fraction following centrifugation, which reflects propensity of the protein to self-associate into a condensate. Administration of H2O2 to cells caused a significant portion of Pbp1 to shift to the soluble fraction, and the protein became more uniformly distributed throughout the cell (protein localization), suggesting that oxidation of the LC domain may promote dissolution of Pbp1 condensates. Moreover, modest concentrations of H2O2 also resulted in significant inhibition of autophagy, consistent with the melting of Pbp1 condensates and corresponding activation of TORC1 signaling (PMID:30982603).

The PrD of Sup35 can also mediate reversible phase separation of Sup35 into non-fibrillar structures in energy-depleted yeast cells by sensing the intracellular pH, which, drops during starvation and other stresses (PMID:30877200). These condensates are distinct and different from fibrillar amyloid-like prion particles. The protective condensate rescues the essential GTPase domain of Sup35 from irreversible aggregation so that it remains functional during harsh environmental conditions. The condensates are liquid-like initially but subsequently solidify to form protective protein gels. Cryo–electron tomography demonstrates that these gel-like condensates consist of crosslinked Sup35 molecules forming a porosus meshwork. A cluster of negatively charged amino acids functions as a pH sensor and regulates condensate formation. The prion domain rescues the essential GTPase domain of Sup35 from irreversible aggregation, thus ensuring that the translation termination factor remains functional during harsh environmental conditions. Phase separation is regulated by the adjacent stress sensor. The synergy of these two modules enables the essential translation termination factor to rapidly form protective condensates during stress. This suggests that prion domains are protein-specific stress sensors and modifiers of protein phase transitions that allow cells to respond to specific environmental conditions (PMID:29301985).; 	Energy depletion causes reversible condensation of Sup35 into intracellular puncta in S. cerevisiae cells expressing GFP-fused Sup35 (in vivo). Sup35 particles dissolved within a few minutes of removing energy stress when cells started growing independent of the presence of chaperones (e.g. Hsp104). Stress-induced Sup35 particles also did not have any of the biochemical features of amyloid-like aggregates (morphology). Starved and energy-depleted yeast experience a reduction in cytosolic pH. By manipulating the cytosolic pH it turned out that acidification was sufficient to induce Sup35 condensates. When 2 μM of purified Sup35 was incubated in physiological buffer in vitro, the protein remained diffuse (protein localization), however, when the pH was reduced from 7.5 to 6.0, condensates of Sup35 formed (protein localization, particle size and count). Sup35 condensates adopted spherical shapes in solution, fused when brought together, deformed when contacting the microscope slide and their photobleached regions quickly recovered fluorescence (morphology), suggesting that they are liquid-like. Sup35 was mobile in growing cells in vivo, but it became immobile (protein localization) when sequestered into condensates, upon stress. This behavior was confirmed in vitro, where Sup35 initially phase-separated to form liquid droplets but then solidified into a gel-like state (morphology) as suggested by fusion and photobleaching experiments. Cryo–electron tomography (imaging assay evidence) of Sup35 droplets revealed that gel-like droplets consisted of an amorphous, yet well-defined, meshwork with an average mesh size of ~10 nm (morphology). Gel-like condensates dissolved (particle size and count) when the salt concentration or pH was raised or in the presence of small amounts of detergents, demonstrating reversibility in vitro. A minimal module consisting only of the prion (N) and the M domain (NM) (mutation, truncation) formed droplets in a reversible and pH-dependent manner in vitro. Removing a linear cluster of ionizable glutamic acid residues within the M domain (mutation, Sup35M3 variant) yields a fully functional Sup35 variant but with altered phase behavior, such that protein-rich droplets formed at pH 7.5 and the pH dependence of droplet formation was discernibly reduced in vitro and in vivo (particle size and count, other change in phenotype/functional readout). Deletion studies suggest that the disordered NM domain alters the phase behavior of the C domain by promoting the formation of reversible gels instead of irreversible aggregates (morphology). The fitness of cells expressing similar levels of full-length Sup35 and the C domain alone (in vivo deletion mutants) have been compared: in the absence of stress the C domain was diffuse and soluble (protein localization) and cells grew normally, showing that the C domain is not aggregation-prone in the cellular environment, presumably because of the presence of ligands such as guanosine 5′-triphosphate. After stress (perturbation of the cell environment to induce phenotypic changes), however, the C domain aggregated in a manner that was similar to that of the full-length protein but after removal of stress, dissolution of C domain aggregates could take several hours, while full length Sup35 condensates dissolved within minutes in wild-type cells (other change in phenotype/functional readout, protein localization). Concomitantly, Sup35C cells took longer to restart growth and exhibited reduced fitness when recovering from stationary phase. This suggests that the NM domain determines the material properties (reversible gel versus irreversible aggregate) of Sup35 in vivo (PMID:29301985)	True	True	reversibility of formation and dissolution (PMID:29301985); morphological traits (PMID:29301985); dynamic movement/reorganization of molecules within the droplet (PMID:29301985)	RNA not required.

The CTD is conserved from humans to fungi, but differs in the number of its heptapeptide repeats, with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. Truncating the CTD of RPB1 in S. cerevisiae to fewer than 13 repeats leads to growth defects, and a minimum of eight repeats is required for yeast viability. The CTD serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Like the human CTD, the shorter yeast CTD formed droplets in a concentration-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of yeast CTD by the yeast TFIIH kinase subcomplex inhibited phase separation (PMID:30127355).	Protein concentration-dependent liquid phase separation of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged yCTD (GST-yCTD fusion protein) was observed in the presence of 16% dextran in vitro (particle size and count by microscopy). In vitro formation of yeast CTD droplets was also resistant against changes in ionic strength and temperature (particle size and count by microscopy).

The sequences of Std1 and its non-puncta forming paralog Mth1 are very similar, with the exception of the N-terminal region, which in Std1 includes 15 asparagines between amino acids 26 and 78. Std1(1–78) forms puncta in sip5Δ cells that colocalize with Hsp104. Thus, the asparagine-rich domain of Std1 is necessary and sufficient for Std1 puncta formation. Sip5 and Snf1 interact with distinct regions of Std1, with Snf1 binding Std1(340–424) and Sip5 interacting with Std1(1–78) and preventing Std1 self-interactions. The Sip5-Std1(1–78) interaction is inhibited by phosphorylation of Sip5 at S236 by the Vhs1 kinase, triggering the release of Snf1 and Std1 accretion. Sequestration of Std1 into puncta requires Hsp104 activity and is sufficient to prevent its corepressor function. One role of reversible Std1 puncta formation is to provide a rapid source of Std1 upon encounter of poor carbonsources (PMID:29249654).	In wild-type cells, in vivo Std1-GFP (fusion protein) localizes—under respiration conditions—to the cytoplasm with an enrichment in the nucleus as assessed by microscopy. When grown in glucose-containing medium (perturbation of the cell environment to induce phenotypic changes), Std1 additionally localizes to puncta in approximately 50% of the cells. Knocking out of SIP5 results in 90% of cells exhibiting Std1 puncta under both fermentation and respiration conditions. The Std1 puncta do not colocalize with the nucleolus, spindle-pole bodies or Hsp42 in vivo, but GFP-Std1 does colocalize with the Hsp104 chaperone as assessed by microscopy. Puncta formation also occurs in vivo when Vhs1 kinase is overexpressed or in a Sip5 S236D phosphomimetic mutant, and is prevented by the Sip5 S236A non-phosphorylable mutation. Std1(78–444) does not form puncta in Sip5Δ cells (knock-out) in vivo, while Std1(1–78) does (mutation, microscopy), thus, the N-terminal asparagine-rich domain of Std1 is necessary and sufficient for Std1 puncta formation. Knocking out HSP104 (change in protein concentration) prevents Std1 puncta formation in vivo when cells are treated with glucose or when SIP5 is deleted (perturbation of the cell environment to induce phenotypic changes). Std1 puncta are not amyloidic but when galactose-grown sip5Δ cells are treated with 1-6 hexanediol, the Std1 puncta are dissolved (particle size and count) and Std1 relocalizes to the cell periphery (protein localization) (PMID:29249654).

The NNS termination pathway contains Nrd1 and Nab3, essential RNA-binding proteins with canonical RNA recognition motifs (RRMs). Changes in the transcriptome following glucose-deprivation are mediated in part by the NNS pathway. The yeast transcription termination factor, Nab3, is targeted to intranuclear granules in response to glucose starvation by Nab3’s proline/glutamine-rich, prion-like domain (PrLD) which can assemble into amyloid in vitro (PMID:25611193). Localization to the granule is reversible and sensitive to the chemical probe 1,6 hexanediol suggesting condensation is driven by phase separation. Nab3’s RNA recognition motif is also required for localization as seen for other PrLD-containing RNA-binding proteins that phase separate. Although the PrLD is necessary, it is not sufficient to localize to the granule (PMID:30557374).	N-terminally GFP-fused Nab3 variants were introduced into cells. Since many of the mutations are lethal, cells also expressed untagged Nab3 on a differently marked CEN plasmid. All Nab3 variants were expressed from the endogenous NAB3 promoter in a strain deleted for chromosomal NAB3 (knock-out). Imaging via confocal microscopy showed that GFP-tagged wild type Nab3 exhibited a pan-nuclear distribution (protein localization) in glucose rich conditions in vivo (perturbation of the cell environment to induce phenotypic changes). In glucose starved cells, Nab3 localized to a granule in the population in which GFP-Nab3 was expressed.; Glucose starved cells with formed nuclear granules were treated with 1,6-hexanediol which caused a virtually complete loss of granules from cells (particle size and count by microscopy), similar to that seen for yeast P-bodies. The observations made by the employed microfluidics chamber were consistent with the results seen above using confocal microscopy. The microfluidics chamber holds yeast cells stationary while allowing rapid switching of extracellular media to monitor Nab3 dynamics before, during, and after glucose starvation. Cells that displayed granules kept their granules for the duration of glucose deprivation. Following the re-addition of glucose, Nab3 granule intensity shifted back to a pannuclear baseline distribution within minutes, showing the rapidity of the response to the reintroduction of glucose. Nab3 mutant lacking its PrLD did not form stable granules (particle size and count by microscopy) under the investigated conditions.

Importantly, and in contrast to S. cerevisiae, Sc. pombe is unable to induce and propagate the prion state of Sup35. Thus, condensate formation, but not prion formation, is conserved among distantly related yeast that diverged more than 400 million years ago and suggests that condensate formation may be the ancestral function of the prion domain of Sup35 (PMID:29301985).	In vivo, S. pombe Sup35 formed stress-dependent intracellular condensates (particle size and count by microscopy).

The cleavage furrow is misplaced or oblique in many of the surviving cells. Purified Mid1p-N452 monomers have a strong tendency to aggregate in vitro when concentrated. Some of the protein precipitates, but much of it forms droplets that grow in size and decrease in number over time, which is characteristic for phase separation of proteins. At a concentration of ∼20 μM, most of the protein partitioned into large droplets after 3 h. During mitosis, these N-terminal constructs concentrated in nodes around the equator that acquired Myo2 and other contractile ring proteins. These cells formed contractile rings from strands of actin filaments and Myo2 slower than wild type cells but placed the septum closer to its normal position and orientation than the Δmid1 strain. In vivo the core of cytokinetic nodes consists of ∼10 copies of Mid1p, 10 dimers of F-BAR protein Cdc15p and IQGAP Rng2p, and 2 dimers of formin Cdc12p. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells has provided data about the organization of the proteins in cytokinetic nodes. More than 2 mDa of protein is crowded together in nodes near the membrane, their local concentrations are ∼500 μM, far above the concentrations that favor phase separation by Mid1p-N452. Formation of a separate phase by Mid1p may facilitate the assembly of nodes.  (PMID: 31243991).	Mid1p-N452 purified from insect cells with phosphatase inhibitors aggregates over time in vitro. Differential interference contrast microscopy at room temperature (DIC) revealed that Mid1p-N452 at concentrations from 3.8 to 23 μM formed droplets, which increased in size over time. These concentrations are far below of those in nodes. Droplets formed earlier and grew faster at higher concentrations. As time passed, numerous small droplets with diameters of ∼0.5 μm were replaced by fewer droplets with diameters of ∼10 μm. A cysteine at the C-terminus of Mid1p-N452 was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide. Labeling strengthened the tendency of the protein to aggregate. In vitro fluorescence microscopy was used to study the droplet formation. The labeled protein (10 μM) formed fluorescent droplets, confirming that they are composed of Mid1p-N452 (PMID: 31243991). High-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells in vivo has provided data about the organization of the proteins in cytokinetic nodes. More than 2 mDa of protein is crowded together in nodes near the membrane, wherein its local concentration is ∼500 μM, far above the concentrations that favor phase separation by Mid1p-N452.
