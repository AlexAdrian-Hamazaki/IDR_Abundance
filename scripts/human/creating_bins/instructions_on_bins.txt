First you have to generate HI information by running bin_by_HI.R
Second you have to generate disorder bins by running bin_by_sidorder.R

Third, you have to run bin_by_abun. This will actually write the files for each of your disordered metrics

One you have run abundance, ou can move on to analysis scripts


~~~For investigating Different Binning~~~
We will be adjusting the bins to make sure we didn't pick an arbitrary bin
To do so, do the following

Alter the bin_percent in bin_by_disorder.R
Run bin_by_disorder.R: This will generate a new human_disorder_bins.tsv
Alter the bin_percent in bin_by_abun.R if you want to change the abundance bins
Run bin_by_abun.R: This wll generate new disopred%bins and iupred%bins, given our new disopred bins
Now you can run the analysis comparisons
